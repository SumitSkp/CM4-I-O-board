The open-source designs for the CM4, provide the pathway to learn from the experts at Raspberry Pi.
Its a customized baseboard for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) that i have designed with changes potent to the a generic requirement in most projects.
Having multiple stable voltage levels (1.8V, 3.3V, 5V, 12V) thanks to the on-board synchronous buck converter (AP64501), 
this board is excellent power source for peripheral units in the system.
Connectivity through Ethernet, USB, and most importantly PCIe mini interface enables this board to more and more possibilities.
